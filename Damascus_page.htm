					<p>Damascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.First settled in the second millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. </p>
					
					<p> After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. Damascus saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. Today, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. As of September 2019, eight years into the Syrian Civil War, Damascus was named the least livable city out of 140 global cities in the Global Liveability Ranking.</p>

					<h3> Umayyad Mosque </h3>

					<p> also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus, located in the old city of Damascus, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. Its religious importance stems from the eschatological reports concerning the mosque, and historic events associated with it. Christian and Muslim tradition alike consider it the burial place of John the Baptist's head, a tradition originating in the 6th century. Muslim tradition holds that the mosque will be the place Jesus will return before the End of Days. Two shrines inside the premises commemorate the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali.</p>
