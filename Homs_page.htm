					<h1>Homs, Arabic: حِمْص </h1>
					<img src="Khaled_Ebn_El-Walid_Mosque3.jpg" alt="The most famous mosque in Homs" />
					<p>is a city in western Syria and the capital of the Homs Governorate. It is 501 metres (1,644 ft) above sea level and is located 162 kilometres (101 mi) north of Damascus. Located on the Orontes River, Homs is also the central link between the interior cities and the Mediterranean coast.</p>

					Before the Syrian Civil War, Homs was a major industrial centre, and with a population of at least 652,609 people in 2004,[11] it was the third-largest city in Syria after Aleppo to the north and the capital Damascus to the south. Its population reflects Syria's general religious diversity, composed of Sunni and Alawite Muslims, and Christians. There are a number of historic mosques and churches in the city, and it is close to the Krak des Chevaliers castle, a World Heritage Site.


					
					<p>Khaled EbnEl-Walid is an Arabic Hero. He was a great leader of Muslems in their old battles. The Mosque in Homs/Syria is the place of his buried body.</p>

					<p>Homs did not emerge into the historical record until the 1st century BCE at the time of the Seleucids. It later became the capital of a kingdom ruled by the Emesene dynasty who gave the city its name. Originally a center of worship for the sun god El-Gabal, it later gained importance in Christianity under the Byzantines. Homs was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century and made capital of a district that bore its current name. Throughout the Islamic era, Muslim dynasties contending for control of Syria sought after Homs due to the city's strategic position in the area.</p>
